#### üå± Background

My academic foundation was laid at Syracuse University, where I majored in Information Science and Supply Chain Management. Over a span of six years, I cultivated a strong proficiency in data cleaning, processing, management, analysis, and visualization. My academic pursuits were further enriched with hands-on experience during four internships, where I honed my capabilities as a data analyst and scientist.

Venturing further into the world of data science and software development, I found a profound passion and calling. I currently serve as a Data Analyst Intern at the Office of Civic Engagement at UChicago. Here, I have not only mastered unstructured data cleaning and analysis but have also excelled in fostering cross-departmental communication and driving program development, scoping, assessment, and evaluations.

#### Software and Web Development Project Highlights

### üìä [DataForGood-Chicago: A Data Analysis and Visualization Tool](https://github.com/uchicago-capp-30320/DataForGood-chicago)

#### Project Overview
The main objective of our web application is to help small and medium-sized nonprofits collect, analyze, and use Census data efficiently to achieve their goals. By using advanced technologies like Python, GIS mapping, and data science techniques, including natural language processing and AI, the application will allow nonprofits to easily access and use the city's resources and information, plan strategically, and make data-driven decisions without needing extensive technical skills.

#### Key components include:

1. **Data and Dashboard**: Select variables and indicators for analysis, generate interactive visualizations, and customizable dashboards for comprehensive insights.
2. **Automated Memo Generation**: Summarize key insights from data and visuals, generate ready-to-use memos or paragraphs.
3. **Maps and City Resources**: Explore and navigate city resources using integrated ArcGIS Online functionality.
Overall, the application aims to bridge the gap between data availability, accessibility, and its effective utilization by nonprofit organizations. It seeks to empower nonprofits to make informed decisions, optimize resource navigation and allocation, and enhance their impact on the communities they serve.

### üçú [Food Accessibility and Security in Cook County](https://github.com/uchicago-capp-30320/DataForGood-chicago)

#### Project Overview
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, food insecurity is ‚Äúa household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food‚Äù (USDA). The project centers on Cook County and uses data from Yelp Fusion‚Äôs API, scraped emergency pantry data from the Sheriff‚Äôs Office‚Äôs, and downloaded demographic data from the US Census Bureau.

For the project, my teammates and I built a dashboard in order to visualize and explore patterns between the following key components affecting food insecurity:

- **Food Access (Proximity to food)**
- **Food Quality**
- **Food Type**
- **Restaurant Cleanliness**
- **Socioeconomic Factors**

Since 1 in 4 children in Cook County are at risk of hunger, we hope that our application can help educate people about food accessibility as it is a critical health issue.

#### Machine Learning Project Highlights

### üßê [AI-Driven Climate Discourse Analysis and Fact-Checking System](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AJ0AWXCcMIJFUk9PVA)

#### Project Overview

The advancement of Large Language Models (LLM) has created opportunities to address societal issues, including combating climate change misinformation. In this paper, we explore the utilization of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze climate-related claims, focusing on sentiment analysis and misinformation classification. 

For sentiment analysis, we used Bag of Words (BOW), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a fine-tuned Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) model. Simple models liked BOW provided our baseline, while advanced models like LSTM and fine-tuned GPT-2 offered better performance in analyzing sentiment. For misinformation, we utilized the Climate Fever dataset, a compilation of verified real-world climate claims. Our fine-tuned DistilBERT model achieved an F1 score of 0.698 for sequence classification tasks on evidence-claim pairs, and our fine-tuned ClimateBERT, a specialized variant of RoBERTa pre-trained on climate- specific information, had an F1 score of 0.72. The most performant model was fine-tuned GPT-2, which achieved an F1 score of 0.725.

Given that BERT models use bidirectional language understanding and GPT models operate unidirectionally, we anticipated BERT-based models to outperform GPT-2, but our results did not support our hypothesis. Our efforts are to contribute to the discourse on climate change communications and the role NLP has in facilitating more informed discussions and decision-making.

#### Process and Machine Learning Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning and EDA
- Topic Modeling
- Sentiment Analysis
- Fact Checking
- Web Interface Development
- Models: LSTM, BOW, GPT-2 fine-tuning, distilbert, ClimateBERT, Logistic Regression, GPT-3

### üèó [Costa Rica Multi-Class Poverty Prediction](https://github.com/sarahwalker10/PuraVida/tree/main)

#### Project Overview

This team project was adopted from the Kaggle competition called "Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction". Sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank, this competition seeks to enhance traditional poverty prediction methods by promoting the development and application of machine learning models. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction

In this study, we propose and evaluate the effectiveness of five supervised machine learning models in predicting poverty levels in Costa Rican households. This research aims to augment policy-making and strategic planning by offering an efficient, data-driven approach to improve household well-being. Utilizing the proxy means test data from the Inter-American Development Bank, we benchmark the performances of Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression models. The Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees models demonstrated superior performance with F-1 of 0.74, while Naive Bayes, KNN, and Logistic Regression models had more modest F-1 scores of 0.54, 0.65, and 0.65, respectively. The conclusion of this paper presents a comprehensive discussion of the successes and limitations of the different models in the context of poverty prediction.

#### Process and Machine Learning Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning and EDA
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Handle High Class Imbalance using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)
- Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression.
